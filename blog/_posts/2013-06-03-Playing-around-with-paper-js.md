title:  Playing Around with Paper.js
---
I have this client, who said if he have to choose between a regular website and
a visual interactive extravaganza, he would always choose the latter ("with good
taste, please"). So here I was, trying desesperately to make something up which 
looked shiny and tasteful.


The first step, after doodling in my sketchbook, is opening Illustrator and
playing with colors and shapes. I remembered a fun plugin named [scriptographer][1]
and inmediately I googled it. The sad news was there's no plugin for CS6 and 
never will be; because (and here comes the espectacular news) the lead developer
decided to work in [porting the plugin to the web][2]!

So I've been playing around [Paper.js][2] (twitter:[@paperjs][3]) and see how can I implement in my client's
website.
